# Miranda's calendar
It is a basic application created just to solve a personal problem.

Automatically displays the day related to Miranda's calendar based on the passage of days on Earth.

Miranda is the world of a fictional story that I developed a while ago. However, Miranda's calendar has a different structure, since the passage of years is different from Earth.
To solve this small problem of understanding what day it was in Miranda, I developed this date viewer that comprises the day, the current season and the year based on the time Miranda was created.
